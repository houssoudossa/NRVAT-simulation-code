Writing this text to log file [ GenoE.log ]
Analysis started: Sun Dec 12 07:55:02 2021

Options in effect:
	--file GenoE
	--make-bed
	--out GenoE

20 (of 20) markers to be included from [ GenoE.map ]
600 individuals read from [ GenoE.ped ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 600 missing
240 males, 360 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 20 SNPs
320 founders and 280 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 20 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 600 missing
After filtering, 240 males, 360 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
